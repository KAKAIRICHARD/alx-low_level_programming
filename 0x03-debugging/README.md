0x03,C-Debugging

0. Multiple mains (File: 0-main.c, main.h) - In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

1. Like, comment, subscribe  (File: 1-main.c) - Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. 0 > 972? (File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h) - Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3. Leap year (File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h) - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
